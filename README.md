# BIG RED DOWNLOAD BUTTON

adds a big red download button to github repo pages, and also hides all the scary dev things; 
shamelessly made with chatgpt over the span of multiple hours while at work because i am in fact an idiot baby

## How to Install

install via chrome extensions page (sorry firefox users, you're not the target demographic)

## Etc.

- doesn't always work because it was made with chatgpt

- also doesn't work on your own repo pages if you're signed in

- also doesn't work unless you reload like half of the time

enjoy
