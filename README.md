# BIG RED DOWNLOAD BUTTON

adds a big red download button to github repo pages, and also hides all the scary dev things; 
shamelessly made with chatgpt over the span of multiple hours while at work because i am in fact an idiot baby

## How to Install

install via chrome extensions page by dragging and dropping. (sorry firefox users, you're not the target demographic)

chrome is stupid as hell and might autodelete the file because it thinks it's malware, if it does that just go to chrome://extensions and drag and drop the file from explorer onto the page

## Etc.

- doesn't always work because it was made with chatgpt

- also doesn't work on your own repo pages if you're signed in

- also doesn't work unless you reload like half of the time

enjoy
