# BIG RED DOWNLOAD BUTTON

shamelessly made with chatgpt over the span of multiple hours while at work because i am in fact an idiot baby

install via chrome extensions page (sorry firefox users, you're not the target demographic)

doesn't always work because it was made with chatgpt

also doesn't work on your own repo pages

also doesn't work unless you reload like half of the time

enjoy
